## Documentation
This project uses leaflet.js and carto.js to [render the map](https://texasappleseed.carto.com/tables/ratiodistrictdaep_merge/public). https://carto.com/docs/

School District level data comes from [disciplinary data products](http://ritter.tea.state.tx.us/adhocrpt/Disciplinary_Data_Products/Download_Region_Districts.html) and [District and Charter Detail Data](http://ritter.tea.state.tx.us/perfreport/snapshot/download.html) published on the Texas Education Agency website.
Some additional data is available from open records requests to the Texas Education Agency, but not currently in use. See Open Austin's [#texasappleseed Slack channel](https://open-austin.slack.com) for more information.
